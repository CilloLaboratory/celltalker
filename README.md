# celltalker

The goal of celltalker is to infer putative ligand and receptor
interactions from single-cell RNAseq data. This is accomplished by
evaluating known cognate ligand/receptor interactions across groups of
cells. Interactions are scored by jointly weighting the expression
levels of ligands and receptors, and significance is evaluated by
comparing to a background distribution of scrambled ligands and
receptors.

A recent refactoring of this package has made the interface much simpler
to use. We also provide a wrapper to the functionality of the [circlize
package](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/) for creating
circos plots of ligands and receptors.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arc85/celltalker")
```

## TL;DR example use

Hereâ€™s a basic use case for celltalker based on a subset of the 40,000
bone marrow single-cell dataset available from the Human Cell Atlas.
Check out SeuratData [here](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data) to
download the example dataset.

Note that we have identified canonical immune cell types and filtered
the dataset for ease of analysis. A vignette documenting this processing
is coming soon, but please utilize the **hca_bm_umap_cell_types**
data.frame for the vignette below.

## Run celltalker
hca_bm_interactions <- celltalk(input_object=hca_bm,

  ligand_receptor_pairs=ramilowski_pairs,
  number_cells_required=100,

## Identify top statistically significant interactions
top_stats <- hca_bm_interactions %>%

  filter(fdr<0.05) %>%
  group_by(cell_type1) %>%

## Generate a circos plot
colours_use <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n=length(unique(hca_bm$cell_types)),"Set2")
