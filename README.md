# celltalker

The goal of celltalker is to infer putative ligand and receptor interactions from single-cell RNAseq data. Briefly, celltalker seeks to evaluate cell-cell communication based on expression of ligands and receptors within and between clusters of cells across experimental groups.

A recent refactoring of this package has made the interface much simpler to use, as reflected in the newest vignette.
