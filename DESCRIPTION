Description: This package uses a count matrix and metadata generated by single-cell RNAseq to evaluate putative cell-cell communication. It does this by utilizing a list of interacting ligand and receptor pairs described in "A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signaling in human" (Ramilowski JA et al, Nature Communications 2015). Briefly, celltalker accomplishes this by building lists of expressed ligands and receptors across clusters and sample groups, then looks for cognate ligand/receptor expression within and between clusters. Methods are provided for visualization of unique and differentially expressed ligand and receptor interactions.
